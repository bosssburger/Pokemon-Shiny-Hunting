# Pokemon-Shiny-Hunting
A simple java project to count encounters while hunting for shiny Pokemon (See "Shiny" and "Shiny Hunting")

I enjoy playing Pokemon and I also enjoy hunting for shiny Pokemon since for the most part, the difficulty of me beating the game has gone down since I was 10 years old. The program enables me to count the encounters which I have gone through so far in order to see how lucky (or unlucky) I am when I finally encounter the shiny. It uses a text file to store the data and displays a picture of the desired shiny in case I forget what it looks like.
